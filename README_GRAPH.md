  ðŸ§  Core Graph Schema (High-level)
Here's a recommended starting model for nodes and relationships:

Facet	Metadata objects attached to jobs, runs, datasets
Owner	Owner information (user, group)
Field	Schema field for a dataset
Transformation	Transformation applied to a column (optional node)

ðŸ”— Relationship Types
Relationship	From â†’ To	Description
EMITTED_BY	Event â†’ Run	Event belongs to a run
EXECUTES	Run â†’ Job	Run is an execution of a Job
INPUT_OF	Dataset â†’ Run	Dataset used as input
OUTPUT_OF	Dataset â†’ Run	Dataset produced as output
HAS_FACET	(Job/Run/Dataset) â†’ Facet	Metadata facets
PARENT_OF	Run â†’ Run	Captures parent-child run lineage
OWNS	Owner â†’ Dataset	Ownership relationship
HAS_FIELD	Dataset â†’ Field	Dataset schema fields
DERIVED_FROM	Field â†’ Field	Column-level lineage
USES_TRANSFORMATION	DERIVED_FROM â†’ Transformation	Optional â€“ to detail transformations
